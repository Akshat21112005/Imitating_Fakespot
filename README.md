**Student ID:** 202301460  

## Objective
This lab introduces basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to convert text into numerical representations and apply machine learning models for classification. The task involves working with e-commerce user reviews for both multiclass and binary classification problems.

## Dataset
The dataset contains user reviews from an e-commerce platform across **10 product categories**.  
Each review includes:
- Product category label
- Review authenticity label (fake or genuine)

## Tasks

### 1. Product Category Classification
- Vectorize review text
- Train a multiclass classification model
- Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

### 2. Fake Review Detection
- Use vectorized text representations
- Train a binary classification model (fake vs genuine)
- Evaluate using suitable classification metrics

### 3. Word Cloud Generation
- Identify important words contributing to fake review classification
- Generate a word cloud for fake reviews
- Briefly interpret why these words may indicate fake reviews
